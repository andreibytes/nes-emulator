# NES emulator

Hello, this project is my current attempt at writing a cycle accurate NES emulator in C++. I come from a background of C programming and I've written a few C++ projects for a couple of my classes at my local university and I want to improve my C++ skills while challenging my self at the same time. I don't expect to finish this project anytime soon but it will be something that I will contribute to in my free time. 

Learning goals
-

- Improve my knowledge of Computer Architecture and assembly language
- Improve my C++ programming skills and object oriented design skills
- Improve my knowledge of computer graphics
